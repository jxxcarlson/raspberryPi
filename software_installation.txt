Installing the software yourself in Raspbian PiFace Digital
communicates to the Raspberry Pi using the SPI interface. The SPI
interface driver is included in the later Raspbian distributions but
is not enabled by default. You can always enable the SPI driver, or
you can load it by hand when required.

Always enabling SPI

To always enable the SPI driver:

 After logging in, edit /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
sudo nano etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

 Insert a # at the start of the line containing blacklist spi-bcm2708 
#blacklist spi-bcm2708

 

Alternatively, to load the SPI driver by hand (will not be loaded on reboot):

Type in a terminal:

  sudo modprobe spi-bcm2708

Next, you we need to install the PiFace Digital libraries and change
the permissions of the SPI interface. The following script automates
this into one command.

To install and setup the software, ensure your Pi can access the Internet and type:

   sudo apt-get update

   wget -O â€“ http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/download/install.txt | bash

The software will complete installing in a few minutes.

Reboot your Pi by typing:

   sudo reboot
